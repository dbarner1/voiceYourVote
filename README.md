<h1>Voice Your Vote</h1>

<p>Welcome to America 2.0, where the citizen has more of a voice.  This is an app that displays my understanding of React, Babel, and Webpack, along with other goodies to create a responsive, beautiful app.</p>

<h2>How It's Made</h2>

<b>Tech used:</b> Javascript, React, React Router, Babel, Webpack, SASS, CSS

I designed this site to display my understanding of React, its Router, and the various technologies needed by a Front End Developer to own the minimization and build of their code.

<h2>Optimizations</h2>

I first designed the structure of the app, then refactored into components, and then added routing behaviors.

<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
